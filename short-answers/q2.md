# Question
Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i)
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but *without* using the `break` statement?

# Answer
We could achive the exact same functionality with a for loop by changing break into continue. Continue allows us to skip as long as i is greater than 7.  

# Teacher Feedback
We could achieve the same functionality with a for loop by using continue instead of using break. continue will just skip any iteration where i is greater than 7.
